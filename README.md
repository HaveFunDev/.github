# Contribution Guideline

Open source is a core principle of HaveFun. That's right, we love your contributions.

It doesn't matter whether it's a simple typo fix, bug fix, documentation addition, redesign of a component, or implementation of a new feature/page, you can contribute.

## Before you contribute, here are some notes

 - There is a technology stack for every project, so make sure you follow it
 
 - Commit messages need to be clean & specific. Hence, please commit with clear commit messages and follow commit rules
 
 - As long as the changes are useful, you can add/improve anything/part of the project
 
 - If you have any suggestions about a new project, or an existing one we would be more than happy to hear them on our discord server.
